Web Article Text Extractor

This Python script allows you to extract the text content from a web article by providing its URL. It utilizes the requests library to fetch the HTML content of the article's web page and the BeautifulSoup library for parsing the HTML and extracting the article text.
Prerequisites

Before you can use this script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

    requests: You can install it using pip:

pip install requests

BeautifulSoup4: You can install it using pip:

    pip install beautifulsoup4

Usage

    Run the script by executing it in your terminal or IDE of choice:

    python script_name.py

    When prompted, enter the URL of the web article you want to extract text from.

    The script will fetch the HTML content of the provided URL, parse it, and attempt to extract the main article text.

    If successful, it will display the text content of the article. If not, it will indicate that it failed to retrieve the content.

Customization

The script is designed as a starting point for web scraping, and you may need to customize it for specific websites. The current implementation is a generic example and may not work seamlessly with all web pages. You can modify the get_article_text function to adapt to the structure of the website you are interested in. Look for the HTML elements that contain the article text and update the code accordingly.

Error Handling

The script includes error handling for cases where the URL cannot be fetched or when the HTML parsing encounters issues. It will display an error message if any exceptions occur during the process.

Please use this script responsibly and ensure compliance with the website's terms of service and legal regulations when scraping content from websites.
